Source control management help manage source code of applications. Each change to a fileor a grup of files.

Git tracks changes made in a source code.

- We initialize a Git repositiry
- Then we configure files to track: Every time we commit a change, Git makes a new copy of the

`Git status` will give us status of our repo
`Git Add Readme.md Main.Py` will add files we want to track and stage them automatically
`Git commit -m "Initial Commit`

The local git repository is the repo local on our PC
THe remote git repo is a central repo where everyone's changes are kepy and merged.

With Git Deamon you can run git as a TCP server. -> Try This (Can i use this to create my own version of Github)

After creating our remote repo, we need to connect it to our local repo
`git remot add name <url>`

the name helps us when we have multiple remote repositories

`git push -u <name> branch`
`git pull name branch`
`git clone url`
