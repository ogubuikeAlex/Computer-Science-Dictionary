## What Are Data Structures

In SWE what we do is primarily manipulate data. Data strcutures are a way to organzie and manipulate data.
it is a collection of data values, their relationships, operations and function that can be applied to them.

## Complexity Analysis

Its common for one problrm to have multiple solutions. The question is are all slutions equal? The answer is no, there are solutions that are bette rthan others.
This is where we talk baout complexity - Not in terms of how "complex" the solution is.
We are talking about space time compexity.

Time comlexoity is how fast the algoitm runs and the space complexoty id the measure of the memory used by an algotirhm.

Complexity analysis is simply umderstanding the compelxity of an algoithm
